# Hi! Welcome to Group 2's Repo!
Everything here was developed to complete requirements for ISYS 5133 and ISYS 5423 in the MIS Graduate Program at the University of Arkansas!

# What is this?
:deciduous_tree: This repo hosts a website for an imaginary town called Moose Hide Landing
:earth_americas: You can visit the site [here](https://dreamy-panini-3ecd39.netlify.app/)!

The project was fairly open ended, but we did have to create some useable services and atleast one of those services had to utilize a blockchain.

:fire: :boom: Our Completed Services were [Pavilion Rentals](https://dreamy-panini-3ecd39.netlify.app/pavilions) and [Hunters Education Cards](https://dreamy-panini-3ecd39.netlify.app/hunting) on a blockchain! :boom: :fire:

# How did we do it?
We used a ton of free services and the [GitHub Student Pack](https://education.github.com/pack), Also: 
- :art: [Canva](https://www.canva.com/design/DAEqHMUV1jI/yO0TfZMgYLWZMXgmgCMsnA/view?website#4:town-of-moose-hide-landing) - mostly for mockups and some icons / graphics
- :tophat: [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) - Javascript Framework which made it super easy to spin up a website for a bunch of beginners :)
- :trophy: [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - A super easy-to-use CSS thing that made styling the website a breeze!
- :dart: [Jotform](https://www.jotform.com/) + [react-jotform-embed](https://github.com/xurei/react-jotform-embed) - both helped us complete our Pavilion Rental Usecase on time!
- :hourglass_flowing_sand: [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) - was way easier than launching the website on Azure, but also I never quite figured out Netlify serverless functions... Maybe next time
- :floppy_disk: [react-icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/) - was a super simple icon integration that helped make some simple UI Components really clear.
- :zap: [ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/) - drives our blockchain integration on Ropsten
- :skull: [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/) - this is how we deployed our Smart Contract on Ropsten
- :fox_face: [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) - Metamask had some excellent docs which made it perfect for our first (and only) wallet integration!
- :star: [OpenZepplin](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/wizard) - their contract wizard made creating our ERC721 contracts super simple! 
- :raised_hands: [FaunaDB](https://fauna.com/) - Fauna was an incredibly easy database to setup, the performance was incredible and we really owe the completion of the Hunters Education Card process to their service and excellent documentations. :clap:
